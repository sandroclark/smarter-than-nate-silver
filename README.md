Smarter Than Nate Silver
========================

Making NCAA March Madness predictions
-------------------------------------
**It's about that time of year again!** Time to fill out a bracket and pick the best college basketball team in America.

_But, how should we pick who wins?_

Tons of very smart people spend an inordinate amount of time trying to answer exactly this question. Nate Silver's website fivethirthyeight.com does a good job of showing probabilities of any team winning the tournament.

_So why the beef with Nate, dog?_

Most of his predictions (as well as others') rely heavily on stats like RPI and Elo scores which are themselves based mostly on the ranking of the team going into the tournament. So, it leans toward picking a winning team based on the higher seed. You can see it based on who fivthirtyeight has picked to be in the Final Four from the last three tournaments:

Hmmmm...that seems to be a lot of No.1 seeds. Perhaps they are seeded higher because they are the better team, so we should use this number, right?

Not exactly, ranking and placing teams in the opening round of the tournament is far more complicated, and even worse, dependent on a panel to decide where each team should rank.

A Rank Agnostic Approach
------------------------
Why not just ignore the rankings, and mine through historical data to evaluate team performance based solely on boxscore data?
